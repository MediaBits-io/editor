# Mediabits.io

Mediabits.io lets anyone create engaging videos for their audio, perfect for sharing on social media.

This is a repository for the main editor, which is currently being rebuilt from scratch. An old version is live on https://mediabits.io

Mediabits.io aims to:

- Be open-source
- Have no watermarks
- Need no login or registration
- Give access to all video editor features for free
- Include no features unrelated to video editing

Mediabits.io Pro will:

- Render longer videos
- Provide transcription
- Save templates and videos in cloud
- Have workspaces for projects, to store and reuse resources like audio, images, fonts, etc.
- Provide pre-built designer templates

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
